## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

You can match all the elements with a class that starts with a specific set of characters. For example, something like

```
    article[class*="card"] {
      margin-bottom: 0;
      padding: 2rem 2.3rem 2.1rem;
    }
```

will match only the articles with a class that starts with “card”.
